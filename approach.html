                <h2>Your voice lives in your body. Let's start there.</h2>
                <p>Most vocal training focuses on hitting the right notes. But if your body is tense, disconnected, or shrinking—your voice will be too.</p>
                <p>I teach singers to <strong>ground in their body first</strong>, using somatic exercises that help you feel safe, open, and present. One of my favorites: the <strong>fiddlehead fern unfurling</strong>—a gentle way to find aligned posture without forcing it.</p>
                <p>When you're grounded in your body, your voice has room to be authentic. Not perfect. Not mimicking someone else. Just <em>yours</em>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-section">
                <h2>Performance isn't just about technique—it's about presence.</h2>
                <p>You can hit every note perfectly and still feel like you're not connecting with the audience (or yourself). That's because performance is about <strong>telling the story</strong>, not just singing the words.</p>
                
                <h3>I help performers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interpret lyrics emotionally (what is this song actually <em>about</em> for you?)</li>
                    <li>Find their stage presence (how do you want to <em>be</em> when you're up there?)</li>
                    <li>Ground themselves when nerves hit (breathwork, body awareness, anchoring)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-section">
                <h2>I teach from two traditions: classical technique + Black American music.</h2>
                <p>I'm trained in <strong>bel canto</strong> (classical Italian vocal technique)—breath support, resonance, open throat. But I also grew up with <strong>soul, gospel, and jazz</strong>—music that's about <em>feeling</em>, not just precision.</p>
                <p>I bring both into my teaching. You'll learn technique that supports your voice long-term, AND you'll learn how to bring soul, authenticity, and story into your performance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="approach-section">
                <h2>No hierarchy. No competition. Just you and your voice.</h2>
                <p>I don't teach you to "beat" other singers or climb some imaginary ladder. I teach you to find <em>your</em> voice and use it the way <em>you</em> want to.</p>
                <p>Whether you're brand new or already performing, whether you want to sing professionally or just for joy—you're welcome here.</p>
